Go Code Club - Projects
========

This is where all the official projects, documentation, and tutorials will be hosted for the Go Code Club

###How to add your assignment:

Some of our assignments will be individual based, so each of you will submit your own copy.  For now, this is how we'll handle it:

- Fork the project
- Create a folder under the project with your username.  For example, mine might be webapps/part1/user/jamieomatthews.  Then, make sure to include any files that are needed to run your example.  
- Send A PR

If this approach becomes problematic, we will handle it at that time.
